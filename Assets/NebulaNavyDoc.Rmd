#Nebula Navy Network Overview

  -Slow
  -Reliable
  -Used for connecting, spawning, etc
-UDP
  -FAST
  -Unreliable
  -Used for movement input pretty much everything

-Terminology
  -Command is from client to server
  -RPC(remote procedure call) is from server to all clients
  -DPC(directed procedure call) specific client
  
#Structure
Allow clients to have autonomy but everything is checked by the server. We can
move our player indepentantly but if the server detects a position in the wall
we need to fix the clients position.
